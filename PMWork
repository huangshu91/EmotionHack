PM Tasks



start preparing these now
---------------------------
need storyline
motivation
elevator pitch
sign up for science fair
clips of us working, etc


demo
----------------------------
get little video clips, projector constantly plays these
need to have someone always available for science fair
need 1 person to be recruiter and get people to come by
handouts - microsoft printing services (potentially? next day delivery).  What can we give them
email to immediate group to come check out our thing and vote for us, etc.
need to have clear plan for who mans the station so make sure everyone is well rested and the demo-conductor is fresh

We may want one of us as the actor for the demo subject rather than a random person.  Some people may not have time to go through the whole video, they may not be expressive, they may not use the program correctly.

misc
-----------------------------
voting button enabled tomorrow
don't be desperate but make sure you ask them for a vote
have one laptop available for them to vote (make voting accessible for others)
some people lazy to type it so jot down alias and you have their consent so you can vote for them


(for second pass of emails, alias)

clips of us, fun things not just strickly storyline.
